Vole
====

Vole is a web application for sharing words, pictures and videos with others. Data is distributed peer-to-peer using Bittorrent Sync.


* A complete introduction is available on [vole.cc](http://vole.cc).
* Please join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vole-dev) for announcements and development discussion.
* Follow us on Twitter [@volecc](https://twitter.com/volecc).

Getting started
---------------

Currently we are pre-release. The following steps are for interested developers.

* [Download Vole](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cd943dyjjavzxk7/uqm3wh37fS) for Mac OSX, Windows or Linux. The current version is 0.1.0.
* Or, you can compile it yourself. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/vole/vole/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Run the Vole application from the command line. First, `cd` into the directory that you placed Vole. Then, on Mac/Linux type `./vole`, and on Windows type `vole.exe`.
* Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:6789](http://localhost:6789).
* Click 'My Profile'
* Enter your name. Enter your Gravatar email (optional).
* Click 'Home'
* Post something.

Sharing and following
---------------------

Start by installing [Bittorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html).

Following and sharing currently involves manually setting up folders, however we'd like to automate it as soon as Bittorrent Sync releases a build that supports control via an API.

Following others
----------------

* Grab the **read-only** ID of the person you want to follow. A directory is in progress at [vole.cc](http://vole.cc). Why not start with Vole Team updates? Our key is RA32XLBBHXMWMECGJAJSJMMPQ3Z2ZGR7K.
* Find the Vole `users` folder. Unless you changed the defaults, it will be in a directory called `Vole/users` in your home folder.
* Create a new folder in `Vole/users`, you should name it after the user that you're about to follow. For example, `Vole/users/voleteam`.
* In BitTorrent Sync, add this new folder as a shared folder, using the read-only key you grabbed in step 1. [Instructions](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync/get-started.html) are available on their site and vary a little by operating system.

* You should receive notification that the folder has sync'd.
* In your browser, see the new posts appear.

Sharing your posts
------------------

Find your own user folder, for example, if you created a profile named 'Chuck':

    /home/chuck/Vole/users/Chuck_9674e8e8-7c7a-41e6-52ed-51a3f7969812

* In Bittorrent Sync, add this folder as a shared folder.
* In the folder options, grab the **read-only key**. Make sure the key starts with the letter 'R' that signifies it's the read-only one. You can find it by going to the advanced folder preferences. This is the key that you can share with others so they can follow your posts.
* If you want to list your key on vole.cc, make a pull request on the [website repo](https://github.com/vole/vole.github.io). Here is an [example](https://github.com/vole/vole.github.io/pull/9).

Configuration
-------------

To override the default configuration options, make a copy of `config.sample.json` and name it `config.json`.
