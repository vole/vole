Vole is a web application for sharing words, pictures and videos securely and privately with others. Data is distributed to users peer-to-peer using Bittorrent Sync.

Getting started
---------------

Currently we are pre-release, so there are no builds available. The following steps are for interested developers.

* Compile and run the Go backend. See [contributing](https://github.com/vole/vole/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:6789](http://localhost:6789).
* Click 'My Profile'
* Enter your name. Enter your Gravatar email (optional).
* Click 'Home'
* Post something.

Sharing and following
---------------------

Start by installing [Bittorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html).

Following and sharing currently involves manually setting up folders, however we'd like to automate it as soon as Bittorrent Sync releases a build that supports command-line control.

Following others
----------------

* Grab the read-only ID of the person you want to follow. A directory is in progress at [vole.cc](http://vole.cc). Why not start with Vole Team updates? Our key is RA32XLBBHXMWMECGJAJSJMMPQ3Z2ZGR7K.
* Find the Vole `users` folder. Unless you changed the defaults, it will be in `~/Vole/users`.
* Create a new folder in `~/Vole/users`, you can name it whatever you like.
* In BitTorrent Sync, add this new folder as a shared folder. [Instructions](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync/get-started.html) are available on their site.
* You should receive notification that the folder has sync'd.
* In your browser, see the new posts appear.

Sharing your posts
------------------

Find your own user folder, for example, if you created a profile named 'Chuck':

    /home/chuck/Vole/users/Chuck_9674e8e8-7c7a-41e6-52ed-51a3f7969812

* In Bittorrent Sync, add this folder as a shared folder.
* In the folder options, grab the read-only key. This is the key that you can share to others so they can follow your posts.

Profile site
------------

We plan on allowing people to claim their names on vole.cc and store their keys along with their profile, making it much easier to find people who are posting publicly.

Technology
----------
